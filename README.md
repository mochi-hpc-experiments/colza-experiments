# Colza Experiments

This repository contains scripts to reproduce experiments
related to the Colza elastic in situ analysis framework.
These experiments were run on the Cori supercomputer.

Each subfolder contains a README file explaining what the
experiment in the subfolder does, how to install its
dependencies, and how to run it.

The ubuntu folder contains scripts that allow reproducing
the most experiments on a single Linux workstation or a
cluster of Linux machines.
